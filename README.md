### alternative systems
it's possible to simulate a alternative systems using a "bound" states by confining particles or waves within specific potentials. Although they differ from true atomic bound states, they capture the essence of confined energy levels and spatial limitations. Each approach offers flexibility, enabling bound state simulations without the need for an atomic nucleus. let try and make a computational models. While in atoms, the bound state is a result of the Coulomb force between an electron and the nucleus, in non-atomic systems, other forces and interactions can mimic this binding effect.

Here are a few ways to simulate or approximate bound states without an actual atom:

### 1. **Electromagnetic Trapping (Penning and Paul Traps)**:
   - **Penning Traps**: These devices use a combination of magnetic and electric fields to trap charged particles, effectively binding them to a fixed position or orbit. Although not a true Rydberg bound state, the particles remain constrained in a defined region and can exhibit orbit-like motion.
   - **Paul Traps**: This technique uses oscillating electric fields to trap ions in a pseudo-potential, allowing them to remain in specific locations. Bound states here can simulate atomic orbits but use electromagnetic fields instead of a nuclear force.

### 2. **Quantum Dots as Artificial Atoms**:
   - Quantum dots, sometimes called "artificial atoms," can confine electrons within a small space, creating a quantized energy spectrum that resembles the electron states in atoms.
   - By adjusting the size, shape, and materials of the quantum dot, one can design energy levels that resemble Rydberg-like high-energy states. Electrons within a quantum dot are bound by the confining potential of the dot rather than by a nucleus, creating a form of bound state that’s tunable and customizable.

### 3. **Cold Atom Traps and Optical Lattices**:
   - **Optical Lattices**: By interfering multiple laser beams, researchers can create a standing wave pattern that traps atoms or particles in periodic potential wells, binding them to specific locations.
   - **Cold Atom Simulations**: In ultracold conditions, neutral atoms can be manipulated to mimic bound states within an external potential, sometimes using artificial magnetic fields. These conditions can simulate interactions and "binding" without an atomic core, and even reproduce behaviors analogous to electron orbits.

### 4. **Simulating Bound States in Computation (Quantum and Classical Simulations)**:
   - Using **quantum mechanics simulations** (e.g., Schrödinger or Dirac equations in a potential well), one can computationally simulate a bound state by creating an attractive potential, like a harmonic oscillator or Coulomb-like potential, and calculating the resulting wavefunctions.
   - This approach doesn’t rely on actual particles but rather on solving the equations for hypothetical particles in a potential, which produces energy levels and states similar to atomic orbitals.
   
### 5. **Metamaterials and Bound State Simulation**:
   - Certain **metamaterials** (engineered materials with properties not found in nature) can simulate bound states by designing regions where electromagnetic waves are confined in a pattern.
   - For example, by creating photonic crystals or plasmonic resonators, it’s possible to trap electromagnetic fields in a manner that mimics bound states. These setups can emulate the spatial confinement seen in atomic orbitals without needing an actual atom.

### 6. **Artificial Atoms in Superconducting Circuits**:
   - In superconducting qubits, energy levels are created by the design of Josephson junctions, allowing for discrete energy states similar to atomic bound states.
   - In such circuits, a particle-like behavior is mimicked by confining the wavefunction within the circuit. While there is no central nucleus, the energy levels are quantized, resembling those found in real atoms.





### 3D Penning trap
wiki; `Penning traps use a strong homogeneous axial magnetic field to confine particles radially and a quadrupole electric field to confine the particles axially. The static electric potential can be generated using a set of three electrodes: a ring and two endcaps.`

So using a **3D Penning trap** without ignoring the \( z \)-axis, you need both the **magnetic field** (to induce circular motion) and a **quadrupole electric field** (to confine the particle along the \( z \)-axis). This combination creates a stable 3D confinement that prevents the particle from spiraling outward.

In a Penning trap, the quadrupole electric field restricts motion along the \( z \)-axis, while the magnetic field in the \( z \)-direction forces circular motion in the \( xy \)-plane. Together, these fields create a 3D trapping potential.

### Explanation

1. **Quadrupole Electric Field**:
   - The function `E(r)` defines the electric field for 3D confinement, where the field confines the particle along the \( z \)-axis and slightly repels in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions. This field creates a restoring force towards the trap center along \( z \), balancing out the magnetic field’s tendency to make the particle spiral.

2. **Magnetic Field in \( z \)-Direction**:
   - The `B_vec` vector defines a constant magnetic field along the \( z \)-axis, inducing circular motion in the \( xy \)-plane. The magnetic force is calculated using the cross product of the velocity `v` and `B_vec`.

3. **3D Confinement**:
   - Both fields work together to keep the particle in a stable, bounded region within the trap, resulting in a helical motion confined within a defined 3D space.

4. **3D Plot**:
   - The plot displays the particle’s trajectory, showing helical or oscillatory motion that remains contained within the 3D space due to the combined fields.

This simulation should demonstrate a stable 3D confinement, with the particle oscillating in the \( z \)-direction while moving in a circular or helical pattern in the \( xy \)-plane, characteristic of a Penning trap.

## epitrochoidal motion

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b94f45c-2839-4198-b2f3-37dc77939db1)


The electric field causes ions to oscillate (harmonically in the case of an ideal Penning trap) along the trap axis. The magnetic field in combination with the electric field causes charged particles to move in the radial plane with a motion which traces out an epitrochoid.
making a simulation models a Penning trap’s confinement of a charged particle by combining magnetic and electric fields. The result is a distinctive pattern of motion that is useful for precision measurements in physics, where the trapped particle’s properties can be studied without it escaping. The simulation illustrates how carefully controlled fields can stabilize and control particle motion in three dimensions.



### Key Concepts of the Penning Trap

This code simulates the motion of a charged particle (like a proton)

1. **Magnetic Field Confinement**:
   - A strong magnetic field is applied along the \( z \)-axis (the vertical axis), which forces the particle to move in circular or spiral paths in the horizontal (radial) \( xy \)-plane. This is due to the Lorentz force, which acts perpendicular to the particle’s velocity and the magnetic field, causing it to circle around the field lines.
   
2. **Electric Field Confinement**:
   - A quadrupole electric field is created by applying voltage to electrodes arranged in a specific shape (usually hyperbolic). This field confines the particle along the \( z \)-axis by creating a "saddle point" in the potential, where the particle is pushed back toward the center if it tries to drift along the \( z \)-axis.
   - The electric field stabilizes the motion along the axial direction, balancing the effect of the magnetic field and preventing the particle from spiraling out of control.

3. **Combined Effect: Cyclotron and Magnetron Motion**:
   - The particle’s motion in a Penning trap is a combination of two main components:
     - **Modified Cyclotron Motion** (\( \omega_+ \)): This is a high-frequency circular motion in the radial plane induced by the magnetic field.
     - **Magnetron Motion** (\( \omega_- \)): This is a slower, large-radius motion in the opposite direction that results from the combined electric and magnetic fields.
   - Together, these two types of motion cause the particle to trace out a complex path called an **epitrochoid** in the radial plane (a flower-like or looping pattern).

4. **Frequency Ratio**:
   - The relationship between the modified cyclotron frequency and the magnetron frequency is crucial. The code aims for a specific frequency ratio (like 8:1) to create the characteristic looping pattern seen in epitrochoidal motion. This ratio is adjusted by tweaking the magnetic field strength and the electric field voltage.

5. **Simulation Process**:
   - The code simulates the particle’s movement step-by-step over time. In each step, it calculates the forces acting on the particle due to the electric and magnetic fields, updates the particle’s velocity and position, and then records the new position.
   - The result is a trajectory showing the particle’s movement in 3D space, with a 2D plot focusing on its looping pattern in the radial plane.

6. **Expected Motion**:
   - With the right balance of electric and magnetic forces, the particle remains trapped in a stable, confined orbit. The radial pattern forms loops or flower-like shapes, characteristic of particles in a Penning trap under epitrochoidal motion.

# physical laboratory experiments
with actual Rydberg atoms (e.g., no vapor cells, lasers, or atomic setups). 

So far we have focuses on **theoretical concepts** and **numerical simulations**, including a 3D Penning trap simulation in Octave/MATLAB that models charged particle motion as an analog for bound/Rydberg-like states.

### To Run the "Experiments" in the Repo
- **Required "gear"**: Just software — Octave (free) or MATLAB to run the provided simulation code from the README.md.
- **No physical lab equipment** is needed or mentioned (no optics, lasers, vapor cells, photodetectors, RF sources, electrodes, etc.).
- **Voltages/frequencies mentioned**: These are purely simulation parameters, not real-world applied voltages:
  - Quadrupole electric potential: V₀ = 10 V
  - Magnetic field: B = 1 Tesla (along z-axis)
  - Other params: Particle charge q = 1.6e-19 C, mass m = 1.67e-27 kg (proton-like), trap size d = 0.01 m, cyclotron frequency ω_c = qB/m, etc.
- No power supplies, DC/AC/RF voltages, or hardware are specified because it's computational.

### Repository Files
The repo only has a README.md (with the simulation discussion/code) and one PDF ("Rydberg_Atom_Electric_Field_Sensors_for_Communications_and_Sensing.pdf"), which appears to be the main document. Details on any physical setups, if they exist, would be in that PDF — check it directly on GitHub for figures, schematics, or parts lists (it couldn't be automatically extracted here).

### Typical Real Rydberg Atom E-Field Sensor Experiments
If you're asking about building/running actual Rydberg atom-based electric field sensors (common in research labs, e.g., with rubidium/cesium atoms), those are advanced atomic physics setups and **not** what's in this repo. Typical requirements include:

- **Lasers** → Two tunable diode lasers (e.g., ~780 nm probe + ~480 nm coupling for Rb Rydberg states), mW-level power, frequency-stabilized.
- **Vapor cell** → Glass cell with Rb/Cs atoms (often heated to ~40-100°C).
- **Optics** → Lenses, beamsplitters, mirrors, optical table, anti-vibration.
- **Detection** → Fast photodiode + transimpedance amplifier, possibly lock-in amplifier.
- **Field application/calibration** → Electrodes or antennas; calibration fields often use DC/AC voltages from 0-100 V (or higher) across plates to generate known E-fields (mV/cm to V/cm range).
- **RF/electronics** → Signal generator for test fields (MHz-GHz), low-noise power supplies, data acquisition (oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer).
- **Safety/environment** → Laser safety gear, vacuum (sometimes), magnetic shielding.

These setups are expensive/complex (university or national lab level) and sensitive to noise/vibrations. If that's what you meant, clarify or point to a specific reference/paper — this repo doesn't provide build details for that.

# Building a functional **Rydberg atom electric field sensor** 
(using electromagnetically induced transparency/Autler-Townes splitting in a room-temperature vapor cell) in a university lab is a major advanced atomic physics project. It typically costs **$200,000–$500,000+** for a basic setup (dominated by lasers), requires expertise in laser stabilization, optics alignment, and vacuum/electronics, and takes months to years to commission. No simple "open-source" full hardware blueprint exists, but many labs follow similar designs inspired by NIST, Princeton, or commercial precursors.

### Core Principle
Two counter-propagating lasers excite alkali atoms (usually ⁸⁷Rb) in a vapor cell to a Rydberg state via a ladder scheme:
- Probe: ~780 nm (5S → 5P)
- Coupling: ~480 nm (5P → Rydberg nS/nD)

An applied RF/DC E-field shifts/splits the EIT signal, read out optically on a photodiode.

### Essential Hardware List with Examples and Likely Costs
Costs are approximate (2025 USD, new from vendors like Toptica, Thorlabs, Vescent; university discounts ~20-30% off). Used/refurbished equipment can cut 30-50%.

#### 1. Lasers (biggest expense)
- **780 nm probe laser** (tunable ECDL, narrow linewidth <1 MHz, ~50-100 mW):
  - Example: Toptica DL pro or TA pro (~75-105 mW versions).
  - Cost: $30,000–$60,000 (including frequency stabilization electronics).
- **480 nm coupling laser** (higher power needed, often frequency-doubled from ~960 nm):
  - Example: Toptica TA-SHG pro or DLC Rydberg Rb II (~500-1000 mW).
  - Cost: $50,000–$100,000+ (doubling cavity + IR laser + amplifier).
- **Frequency stabilization** (locks to atomic transitions; often saturated absorption or transfer cavity):
  - Example: Toptica DLC pro locks or wavemeter.
  - Cost: $20,000–$40,000.

#### 2. Vapor Cell and Housing
- **Rubidium vapor cell** (glass, ~75 mm long, often with stem for Rb reservoir):
  - Example: Thorlabs GC19075-RB (natural Rb) or GC19075-RB87 (pure ⁸⁷Rb), quartz for better UV/IR transmission.
  - Cost: $1,000–$3,000.
- **Cell heater/mount** (temperature control ~40-100°C for vapor density):
  - Example: Thorlabs GCH25-75 heater + TC300 controller.
  - Cost: $1,500–$3,000.

#### 3. Optics and Beam Delivery
- Optical table (vibration-isolated) + breadboards/posts/mirrors/lenses/beamsplitters/PBS/AOMs (for frequency shifting/locking).
  - Cost: $20,000–$50,000 (full setup; Thorlabs/Newport).
- Optical isolators, fibers (optional for portable probe), waveplates.
  - Cost: $10,000–$20,000.

#### 4. Detection and Electronics
- Fast photodiode (balanced for noise reduction) + transimpedance amplifier.
  - Example: Thorlabs or Newport high-speed PDs.
  - Cost: $2,000–$5,000.
- Oscilloscope/spectrum analyzer/lock-in amplifier (for signal readout).
  - Cost: $5,000–$20,000.
- RF source for calibration (signal generator + horn antenna).
  - Cost: $5,000–$15,000.

#### 5. Optional/Advanced
- Magnetic shielding (mu-metal) and coils (for zeroing B-fields).
  - Cost: $5,000–$10,000.
- Data acquisition (DAQ card + computer control).
  - Cost: $2,000–$5,000.

**Total likely cost for a minimal working university setup**: $200,000–$400,000 (lasers ~70%). Full professional-grade (e.g., with fiber-coupling, auto-locking): $500,000+.

### Voltages and Power Supplies
- No high voltages for the atoms themselves (room-temperature vapor, no trap).
- DC calibration fields: Low-voltage power supplies (0-100 V) across electrodes near/inside cell for ~V/cm fields.
- RF test fields: Standard signal generator (mW-level into antenna).
- Lasers need stable current/temperature controllers (included with systems).

### Recommendations for a University Lab
- Start with a 780 nm system for basic EIT/spectroscopy (~$100k), then add 480 nm.
- Collaborate or use shared facilities (many AMO groups have parts).
- Commercial options emerging (e.g., Rydberg Technologies probes, but not cheap/open).
- Papers from NIST (Holloway group) or reviews provide schematics—replicate those.

This is not plug-and-play; alignment and stabilization are tricky. If your lab has cold atom experience, it's feasible; otherwise, consider simulations or partnering. Clarify if you want references to specific build papers!
